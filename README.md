# Image Forensics - Analysis of manipulated images

# Problem Statement:
To analyze altered and manipulated images based on forensics tests and predict the proportion of alteration performed on the image.

# Motivation: 
The 21st century is an open digital book, and we live in it. Due to the widespread accessibility of the internet, social media sites play a significant role in this section. With exponential growth of social media and media devices, large amounts of content like images are shared across the web. Also, easy availability of image editing softwares enables image manipulation and altering practices to be performed effortlessly. Many people assume that the information posted on social media is accurate without checking the material's real source and there lacks a platform which is able to check the credibility of the same. The project's goal is to deem credibility of images shared online and provide a certain percentage of the image alteration.

# Methodology:
1. Construct a dataset consisting of unaltered images.
2. Developing machine learning based forensics algorithm.
3. Training suitable models based on dataset.
4. Testing on a variety of manipulated samples
4. Comparative analysis - Fetch the accurate percentage of manipulation of the image.

# Requirements: 
Functional Requirements:
1. Image Authentication roots.
2. Percentage of the original image tampered.
3. Presenting the hotspots of the altered image.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Security
2. Data Integrity
3. Serviceability
4. Scalability

Tools and Technology:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Algorithm.
3. Image Data Processing tools.
